### Updating Data

- No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarely Stored Information

- The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.

- After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

- Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data

#### Automatic Removal

- Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.

#### Manual Removal

- Manual removal of the data can be requested by creating a ticket in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/MdFUxqSTEk) for the bot.

- For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
#### Technical limitations
- The automatic removal of data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.

- Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.

- In such events can you request manual removal as mentioned above.
